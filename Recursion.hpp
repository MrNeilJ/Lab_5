 * Description: This is the member  function header file that
 * hosts all the guts of the functions used in the main.cpp file.
 * In here we make a function that takes in string, and prints
 * out the reverse of the string. Another function that takes
 * in an array and size of the array, and then prints out the
 * total sum of the array added up.  Lastly there is a function
 * that takes in a row value, and returns the total number of
 * "pins" required to make that triangle.
